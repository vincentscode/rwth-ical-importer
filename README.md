# RWTH ical/ics Importer

This is a standalone script based on https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/ (that consists of multiple files).
The purpose is to sync your RWTHonline personal calendar to Google Calendar.
Google Calendar *can* already do this, but updates only happen once every 12 or even 24 hrs. This script can be run much more frequently.
This script also includes multiple qol improvements such as:
 - filtering unwanted events
 - translating room names into understandable ones

[If you want to use this, please copy the script from here]()

**To make a copy in the new Google Apps Script interface:**
1. Go to the project overview icon on the left (looks like this: â“˜)
2. Click the "copy" icon on the top right (looks like two files on top of each other)

**NOTE:** If too many people are accessing the file at the same time, Google may lock you out. You can follow these instructions to set up the script: https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/wiki/Setting-up-the-script-manually
